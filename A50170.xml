            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore Printed an ingenious little Book wearing this Title, <hi>The Divine Management of

The grand Equipage of Metropolitans, of Primates, of Exarchs, of Patriarks, was yet unknown; nor does it any more appear to us, that the Churches then had their Provincial, National, and Oecumenical Synods; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church was its own Miſtreſs, and independent on any other.</hi> But on the other ſide, our <hi>Eliot,</hi> who was no <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> conceived <hi>Synods</hi> to be the Inſtitutions of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Apoſtolical Churches themſelves</hi> acknowledging a Stamp of <hi>Divine Right</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>Such as theſe were the ſentiments of our <hi>Eliot;</hi> &amp; his deſerved Reputation in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>New-England,</hi> is that which has cauſed me to foreſee ſome Advantage and Benefit ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto the concerns of the Goſpel, by ſo large a Recitation as I have now made thereof.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was his wiſdom that he began with them upon ſuch principles, as they themſelves had already ſome Notions of; ſuch as that of an <hi>Heaven</hi> for good, and <hi>Hell</hi> for bad people, when they <hi>Dy'd.</hi> It broke his gracious heart within him to ſee, what Floods of Tears fell from the Eyes of ſeveral among theſe Degenerate Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, at the firſt Addreſſes which he made unto them; yea, from the very worſt of them all. He was very inquiſitive to learn who were the <hi>Powawes,</hi> that is, the <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Seducers,</hi> that maintained the Worſhip of the Devil in any of their Societies; and having in one of his firſt Journeys to them, found out one of thoſe Wretches, he made the Indian come unto
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101216:53"/> him and ſaid, <hi>Whether do you ſuppoſe</hi> God, <hi>or</hi> Chepian <hi>(i. e. the Devil) to be the Author of all good?</hi> The Conjurer anſwered, <hi>God.</hi> Upon this he added with a ſtern Countenance, <hi>Why do you pray to</hi> Chepian <hi>then?</hi> and the poor man was not able to ſtand or ſpeak before him; but at laſt made promiſes of Reformation.</p>
                  <p>The Text which he firſt Preach'd upon, was that in Ezek. 37.9, 10. <hi>That by Propheſying to the Wind, the Wind came and the dry bones lived;</hi> and it was an obſervation made by one, who then juſtly confeſſed, there was <hi>not much weight</hi> in it; That the word which the Indians uſe for <hi>Wind</hi> is <hi>Wauban,</hi> and an Indian of that Name was one of the firſt that here zealouſly promoted the Converſion of his Neighbours. But having thus entred upon the <hi>Teaching</hi> of theſe poor Creatures, t'is incredible how much time, toyl, and hardſhip, he underwent in the Proſecution of this Undertaking; how many weary dayes and nights rolled over him; how many tireſome Journeys he endured; and how many terrible dangers, he had experince of. If you briefly would know <hi>what</hi> he felt, and <hi>what</hi> carried him through all, take it in his own words, in a Letter to the Honourable Mr. <hi>Winſlow;</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have not been dry night nor day, from the third day of the week unto the ſixth, but ſo Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and at night pull off my Boots, wring my blockings, and on with them again, and ſo continue,

                  </p>

                  <p>SO little was the Soul of our <hi>Eliot</hi> infected with any Envy, as that he long'd for nothing more than <hi>Fellow-Labourers,</hi> that might move and ſhine in the ſame <hi>Orb</hi> with himſelf; he made his cryes both to God and Man, for more <hi>Labourers</hi> to be <hi>thruſt-forth,</hi> into the <hi>Indian-Harveſt;</hi> and indeed it was an <hi>Harveſt</hi> of ſo few ſecular Advantages and Encouragements, that it muſt be nothing leſs than a Divine <hi>Thruſt,</hi> which could make any to <hi>Labour</hi> in it. He ſaw the Anſwer of his prayers, in the Generous and vigorous Attempts made by ſeveral other moſt worthy preachers of the Goſpel, to <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellize</hi> our periſhing Indians. At the writing of my Fathers letter there were <hi>Four;</hi> but the Number of them increaſes apace among us. At <hi>Martha</hi>'s Vineyard, the old Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> and ſeveral of his Sons, or Grandſons have done very worthily for the Souls of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; there were fifteen years ago, by compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, about fifteen hundred Seals of their Miniſtry upon that one Iſland. In <hi>Connecticut,</hi> the holy and acute Mr. <hi>Fitch,</hi> has made noble Eſſays towards the Converſion of the Indians, but, I think, the <hi>Prince</hi> he has to deal withal,

And godly Mr. <hi>Pierſon,</hi> has in that Colony, deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well, if I miſtake not, upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

                  <p>'Tis my Relation to him, that cauſes me to defer unto the laſt place, the mention of Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> who addreſſes the Indians in their own Language with an admirable Dexterity, and has done more than a little Service for them.

                        <hi>Noah</hi> Sacrificed, and ſo Worſhipped. This was the manner of old time. But what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> have we <hi>now</hi> to offer? I ſhall anſwer by that in Pſal. 4.5. <hi>Offer to God the Sacrifice of Righteouſneſs, and put your Truſt in the Lord.</hi> Theſe are the true Spiritual <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which God requireth at <hi>our</hi> hands, the <hi>Sacrifices of Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, we muſt look to our hearts and ways, that they be <hi>Righteous;</hi> and then we ſhall be acceptable to God when we Worſhip him. But if we be unrighteous, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ungodly, we ſhall not be accepted; our <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> will be ſtark naught.

Only, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not us to Sacrifice our <hi>Sons,</hi> but our <hi>Sins;</hi> our deareſt <hi>Sins.</hi> God calls us this day to part with all our <hi>Sins,</hi> tho' never ſo beloved; and we muſt not with-hold any of them from him.

                        <hi>God ſmelt a ſweet ſavour in</hi> Noahs <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and ſo will God receive our Sacrifices, when we Worſhip him aright.
